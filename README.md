# Ryoshi
A simple Discord bot (in progress) for tracking the timing of special events like World Bosses, Field Bosses, and Golden Bells in Black Desert Online.

Special thanks to the guys at DSharpPlus (https://dsharpplus.emzi0767.com/) and Discord.NET (https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) for making this so easy to write.

To run this code from your own computer, start a new C# Console App (.NET Framework) project, use Nuget Package Manager to import all necessary packages (see DSharpPlus), copy these files into the project (overwriting Program.cs), change namespace appropriately, create a bot (see Discord Apps Documentation) and invite it to your server, edit the "Token" line in Ryoshi.cs to use your bot's token, compile, and run the .exe.

Visit us at https://discord.gg/ndVAvQ3 and use the #timer with the museifu who created it. ;)

Instructions for using Ryoshi's commands can be found at our server under #news.
